    ++ for host/client expansion:
        - Host would need to associate IP address/port traffic with a given player/color.
        - Host is responsible for being the "decider" and updating the clients with state information?
            Yes. Each client only needs to make one connection this way. Host can relay information to each client.
        - Communication need only be three things:  1) A heartbeat to manage disconnections
                                                    2) A msg regarding which piece is snapping to which grid squares
                                                    3) A msg when a piece has been played.

           This will require a way to uniquely identify pieces. Need to envision the board as an API. A Host/client
           should be able to utilize the API just like the controller class does.

	++ Accomplished goal of practicing MVC.
	++ Need to think of how to add networked multiplayer.  Likely requires refactoring.
	++ Should consider refactoring with performance in mind. Redrawing everything isn't great.

	++ Seems like the current architecture makes it impossible for the view to contain a button whose activation should alert the model.
	    Currently no clean way for the model to communicate to the view whose turn it is.  We need a more robust means of communication.

	== Current architecture of the program might be going ham on stack frames, getting higher every time a function in a different MVC component is called.

	++Been some time since I've worked on this. Code quality and organization aside, It looks like implementing the concept of player turn should come first, followed
	followed by a process to evaluate the validity of a move.
		
		: Turn switch now active for hard coded blue and red players. 

	== Added logic for checking move validity today. 

-- looks like the Frame widget can't bind <Motion>. Fortunately root can
